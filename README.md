# PLinearRegression
Scikit-Learn's linear regression extended with p-values.

> "... the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis." -  R. A. Fisher 

People from [R](https://www.r-project.org/) background are familiar with [hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) and [p-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) whereas ones from Python's [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) background haven't heard of them. That's why I just made this script, which is an extension of scikit-learn's [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html), it can also be extended to Lasso and Ridge regressions respectively.

critiques and comments are always welcome.
